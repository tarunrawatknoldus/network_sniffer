# Network Sniffer with API Integration

Happy Sniffer

## Description

The Network Sniffer project is an implementation of a packet capturing and analysis tool written in Rust. It allows you to monitor network traffic, capture packets, and analyze their metadata. In addition to the Rust sniffer, this project includes an API built using Express.js that connects to a PostgreSQL database to fetch and display the captured packet metadata.

## Features

- **Packet Capturing**: The network sniffer captures packets from the specified network interface in real time.

- **Packet Metadata Analysis**: It extracts important metadata from the captured packets, including source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers, flags, and window size.

- **Database Storage**: The captured packet metadata is stored in a PostgreSQL database, providing a persistent record of network activity.

- **API Integration**: The Express.js API connects to the PostgreSQL database and fetches the captured packet metadata.

- **Web-Based Interface**: The API provides a web-based interface where users can view the captured packet metadata in a user-friendly format.

- **Concurrency**: The sniffer uses Tokio, a powerful asynchronous runtime for Rust, to handle multiple client connections concurrently.

- **Error Handling**: The project implements robust error handling to ensure smooth operation and graceful degradation in case of unexpected errors.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-sniffer.git
cd network-sniffer
```

2. Install the required dependencies for both the Rust sniffer and the Express.js API:

```
cd sniffer
cargo build

cd ../connection
npm install
```

3. Set up the PostgreSQL database with the following credentials:

   - Database URL: `postgres://postgres:your_password@localhost:5432/databasename`

4. Start the network sniffer and the Express.js API:

```
cd sniffer
cargo run

cd ../connection
node app.js
```

5. The sniffer will start listening on `localhost:8000` for incoming client connections.

6. Connect to the sniffer using a TCP client, such as `telnet` or a custom client application.

7. Once connected, the sniffer will capture incoming packets, display their content, and store the extracted metadata in the database.

8. Access the API using a web browser or a tool like `curl` to view the captured packet metadata:

   ```
   curl http://localhost:8086/
   ```

## Example Usage

```
// Connect to the sniffer using a TCP client
telnet localhost 8000

// Sample output on the client side
Received message: This is a sample message from the client.

// Sample output on the server side
data: Some(PacketMetadata { src_ip: None, dst_ip: None, src_port: 1234, dst_port: 5678, seq_number: 1, ack_number: 2, flags: 0, window_size: 4096 })

// Access the API to view captured packet metadata
curl http://localhost:8086/
```

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the Rust community and Tokio contributors for their fantastic work in developing the language and asynchronous runtime, and to the Express.js community for providing a robust and flexible framework for building APIs.

Happy sniffing and exploring the captured network data! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
